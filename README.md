# Analyzing India’s Total Trade Value and GDP Per Capita

This project analyzes **India’s total trade value** (exports + imports as a percentage of GDP) and **GDP per capita** from 1960 to 2023 using data from the World Bank. Using **Power BI** for data visualization and a **PowerPoint presentation** to summarize insights, the project explores India’s trade openness and economic growth over time. It also examines how these trends relate to global events, such as the US-China trade war, and India’s evolving role in the global economy.

## How to Use

1. **Data File**:  
   - Open `data.csv` in any spreadsheet application (e.g., Excel, Google Sheets) to explore the raw data.

2. **Power BI Report**:  
   - Open `report.pbix` in **Power BI Desktop** to interact with the visualizations.  
   - Download Power BI Desktop for free from the [Microsoft website](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/desktop/) if you don’t already have it.

3. **PowerPoint Presentation**:  
   - Open `presentation.pptx` in Microsoft PowerPoint (or compatible software) to view the summarized findings.

## Data Source

The data comes from the **World Bank** and spans **1960 to 2023**. It includes two key metrics:
- **Total Trade (% of GDP)**: Measures India’s trade openness, calculated as (exports + imports) / GDP.
- **GDP Per Capita (USD)**: India’s GDP per capita in current US dollars, reflecting economic growth.

## Tools Used

- **Power BI**: For data cleaning, transformation, and creating interactive visualizations.
- **PowerPoint**: For presenting the analysis in a concise, accessible format.

## Key Findings

- **Trade Openness**: India’s total trade as a percentage of GDP was low (7%–15%) from 1960 to the 1990s. After economic liberalization in 1991, it rose sharply, peaking at **55.8% in 2012**, and was **45.9% in 2023**.
- **Economic Growth**: GDP per capita grew from below $200 in the early 1990s to **$2,480 in 2023**, reflecting steady post-reform growth.
- **Correlation**: There’s a positive link between GDP per capita and trade openness, showing that economic growth coincided with greater global trade integration.
**Global Context**: India’s trade openness (45.9% of GDP in 2023) offers opportunities (e.g., benefiting from trade shifts due to the US-China trade war) but also risks (e.g., exposure to global disruptions).

## Challenges and Limitations

- The analysis focuses on **total trade value** rather than the **trade deficit**, so it doesn’t address whether imports outpace exports.
- Data ends in 2023, missing more recent global events or policy shifts.
